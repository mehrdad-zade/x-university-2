Background Workers Package

This package is reserved for future background task processing capabilities
in the X University platform.

Planned Features:
- Email notification processing
- Report generation and data analytics
- Batch operations for course content processing
- Scheduled maintenance and cleanup tasks
- AI content generation pipelines
- Payment processing workflows

Implementation will use:
- Celery or similar task queue for distributed processing
- Redis or RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Async task execution with proper error handling
- Progress tracking and status reporting
- Retry mechanisms for failed tasks

Currently this package is empty but maintains the structure
for future implementation of background processing capabilities.

Version: 0.1.0
